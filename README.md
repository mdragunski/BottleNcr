# BottleNcr

This tool was built during the study project 'Python in GIS' at [ifgi](https://www.ifgi.de) in the summer term 2017.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

* ArcGIS 10.5 or higher
* tested on Python 2.7.12

**not tested on ArcGIS Pro!**

### Installing
1.  Download this repository as .zip file and unzip all files to your desired location. 

### How to run?
1.  Open ArcMap
2.  Create a folder connection to the unzipped files
3.  Inside of the folder connection, open the Toolbox and start the script `BottleNcr`
4.  Select your track (as .shp file) in which you want to identify bottlenecks
5.  Navigate to a folder where you want to store the results
6.  Now run the script

### Results
You can now see the colored track in ArcMap, where green indicates slow speeds, yellow medium speeds and red high speeds. Furthermore, you can see bottlenecks indicated by blue areas. The darker the blue area the higher the point density.

Besides that, your output folder opens and you can inspect the plots.
